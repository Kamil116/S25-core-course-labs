# Choice justification
I have chosen JavaScript, HTML, and CSS as the technology stack because of my prior experience with these languages, along with their foundational role in web development.
# Best practices

- Error handling - using `catch()` for promise to handle API failures gracefully
- Separation of JS, HTML code. For further improvements: CSS can be separated from HTML file
